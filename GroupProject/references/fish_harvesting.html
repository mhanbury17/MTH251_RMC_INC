                <h1>FISH.NET - FISH HARVESTING</h1>
                <div class="report">
                <p>
                    First described by economist William Forester Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion about overgrazing cattle,
                    <br>the Tragedy of the Commons was born. Garrett Hardin, roughly one-hundred years later, revised the
                    <br>concept to describe the phenomena that occur when a limited resource is shared and harvested at 
                    <br>different rates. The basic concept is that there is a limited resource that is being harvested and
                    <br>is of popular demand. Being limited, that resources holds a threshold at which it can be harvested
                    <br>without complete and immediate depletion.
                    <br>
                    <br>Several businesses today struggle in maintaining this threshold and understanding the effect of 
                    <br>their harvesting rates on that threshold. More specifically it can be difficult to understand how
                    <br>under harvesting compares to over-harvesting and what can be done to recover from these situations.
                    <br>
                    <br>Previously, we have worked personally with a fish hatchery that undergoes this phenomenon 
                    <br>consistently. From that experience, we were able to develop a differential equation to model what
                    <br>that hatchery’s fish population, P, would look like over a significant amount of time, t, where the
                    <br>population is in thousands and time is in years.

                    <br>
                    <br>Recently, the owners of Fish.net purchased this hatchery with the intention of allowing fishing to
                    <br>the public. Being inexperienced with hatcheries and how harvest rates can dramatically affect
                    <br>population, the hatchery’s population was fluctuating fast. Upon seeing our previous success with
                    <br>the hatchery, the owners of Fish.net decided to reach out to us for assistance in repairing the
                    <br>population loss to the hatchery. In our initial report to them, we explained an altered model equation
                    <br>to help us understand how their fish population would be affected by different harvesting rates.
