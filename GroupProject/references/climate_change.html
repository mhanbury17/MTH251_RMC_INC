        <h1>GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
        <div class="report">
            <p>
                Whether we choose to believe it or not, climate change is amongst us. Since the Industrial Revolution
                <br>began back in 1840, the Earth’s temperature has increased 1.5 degrees. While this change may appear
                <br>small, to put it in perspective, a 5˚ change engulfed most of North America in an extreme amount of
                <br>ice. We now, more than ever, need to develop means of controlling this global climate change. As part
                <br>of understanding this climate change, there is often concern resulting from positive feedback loops.
                <br>In a positive feedback loop two or more processes amplify each other, creating a vicious cycle of
                <br>amplification.
                <br>
                <br>Of the positive feedback loops in relation to climate change, interaction of water vapor with global
                <br>temperature is of the most significant. If there is an increase in global temperature, the capacity
                <br>of the atmosphere for evaporated water vapor increases proportionally. So, if water is available for
                <br>evaporation, then the water vapor in the atmosphere will increase. Additionally, water vapor is a
                <br>greenhouse gas and therefore if more water vapor is evaporated than more insulation will be added to
                <br>the atmosphere and increase global temperature.
                <br>
                <br>Scientists have predicted that if global temperatures increase two degrees, a positive feedback loop
                <br>will begin that would result in an additional temperature rise of four degrees. An increase of that
                <br>severity would be enough to turn rainforests into deserts, melt the ice caps, and may even make some
                <br>of the currently habitable locations for humans inhabitable.

                <br>Our team, along with the help from several other scientists, are committed to preventing this future
                <br>crisis. After significant research, we have developed a differential equation to model global climate.
                <br>Using predictions for rising global temperature, our equation models the behavior of the temperature,
                <br>C, in Celsius, and uses k as a parameter to that represents government regulation of greenhouse gas
                <br>emissions. Currently, the equatorial temperature is 20˚C and the governmental regulation for greenhouse
                <br>gases is at a baseline. With current technologies, greenhouse gas emission is necessary for progress.
                <br>Our teams’ goal is to understand how exactly changing regulation will affect the future climate and
                <br>ultimately what we can do to prevent the future positive feedback loop.
