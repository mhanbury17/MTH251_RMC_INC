        <h1>GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
        <div class="report">
            <p>
                Whether we choose to believe it or not, climate change is amongst us. Since the Industrial Revolution began back in 1840, 
                <br>the Earth’s temperature has increased 1.5 degrees. While this change may appear small, to put it in perspective, a 
                <br>5-degree change engulfed most of North America in an extreme amount of ice. We now, more than ever, need to develop 
                <br>means of controlling this global climate change. As part of understanding this climate change, there is often concern 
                <br>resulting from positive feedback loops. In a positive feedback loop two or more processes amplify each other, creating 
                <br>a vicious cycle of amplification.
                <br>
                <br>Of the positive feedback loops in relation to climate change, interaction of water vapor with global temperature is of 
                <br>the most significant. If there is an increase in global temperature, the capacity of the atmosphere for evaporated water 
                <br>vapor increases proportionally. So, if water is available for evaporation, then the water vapor in the atmosphere will 
                <br>increase. Additionally, water vapor is a greenhouse gas and therefore if more water vapor is evaporated than more 
                <br>insulation will be added to the atmosphere and increase global temperature.
                <br>
                <br>Scientists have predicted that if global temperatures increase two degrees, a positive feedback loop will begin that 
                <br>would result in an additional temperature rise of four degrees. An increase of that severity would be enough to turn 
                <br>rainforests into deserts, melt the ice caps, and may even make some of the currently habitable locations for humans 
                <br>inhabitable.

                <br>
                <br>Our team, along with the help from several other scientists, are committed to preventing this future crisis. After 
                <br>significant research, we have developed a differential equation to model global climate [Figure 2.1]. Using predictions 
                <br>for rising global temperature, our equation models the behavior of the temperature, C, in Celsius, and uses k as a 
                <br>parameter to that represents government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the equatorial temperature is 
                <br>20 degrees Celsius and the governmental regulation states no greenhouse gases are to be emitted. With current technologies, 
                <br>greenhouse gas emission is necessary and so some amount of regulation must be permitted. Our teams’ goal is to understand 
                <br>how exactly changing regulation will affect the future climate and ultimately what we can do to prevent the future positive 
                <br>feedback loop.
                <br>
                <br>Our team, in order to push our idea’s forward, wrote a report directed to congress and the president sharing our findings. 
                <br>Our report outlined the effects of different regulation on the current global climate. Our explanation went as follows.
                <br>
                <br>It is to be understood that with our current technologies, greenhouse gas emission is vital for progress. Given that our 
                <br>current regulation does not allow any emission we want to understand what happens to global temperature in three cases. 
                <br>Those three cases include, increased regulation, decreased regulation, and unchanged regulation. In relation to our model, 
                <br>that would follow as k values greater than zero, less than zero, and equal to zero. 
                <br>
                <br>Evaluating our model for a k-value of zero leaves us with a cubic function with three zeros. Our model is a rate of change 
                <br>function in terms of temperature, so the zeros would represent temperatures that result in no change over time.
                <br>
                <br><img src="EQ(8).png" style="margin-left: 350px;">
                <br>
                <br>The zeros occur at C-values of 20, 22, and 26. Considering that the current equatorial temperature is 20 degrees, which is 
                <br>one of our zeros, we can determine that the temperature will remain unchanged as long as regulation remains unchanged. If 
                <br>the current temperature were to be a different, the resulting temperature over time may have been completely different. By 
                <br>plugging in values around our zeros, we can understand how the temperature may have changed in time. Plugging in a temperature 
                <br>less than 20 degrees into our model results in an overall positive answer, which would mean a positive increase in temperature. 
                <br>It is important to also note as the temperature would not be able to exceed 20 degrees as it is one of our zeros and does not 
                <br>allow change, therefore the temperature would rather just approach 20 slowly overtime. For a temperature greater than 20 degrees 
                <br>but less than 22 degrees, the model would give out a negative answer, meaning a decreasing temperature. Again, the temperature 
                <br>would not be able to decrease less than 20 degrees and would instead slowly approach it. The same pattern continues for values 
                <br>between 22 and 26 degrees, where the result is a positive growth that approaches a temperature of 26 degrees. Finally, if the 
                <br>temperature had been above 26 degrees, the result would have been a negative answer ergo a decreasing result approaching 26 
                <br>degrees. The previous behaviors described are easier visualized by graphing our model with a k-value of zero [Figure 2.2].
                <br>

                <br><a style="margin-left: 435px;font-size: 10px;">[Figure 2.2](desmos.com)</a>
                <br>
                <br>In the graph, values above the x-axis, or t-axis in this case, represent growth where values below the t-axis represent 
                <br>decreasing temperatures. For different amounts of regulation, where regulation in our model is simply a constant, the graph is 
                <br>shifted up or down in the plane. For decreased regulation, the function is shifted up, which results in the 20- and 22-degree 
                <br>equatorial temperatures to approach each other and the 26-degree equatorial temperature to increase slowly. With enough 
                <br>regulation, there would only be one equatorial temperature at some value greater than 26. For increased regulation, the behavior 
                <br>is similar as the function is shifted downward. Instead of the 20- and 22-degree equatorial temperatures approaching one-another, 
                <br>the 22- and 26-degree equatorial temperatures do, and the 20-degree temperature decreases slowly. Eventually, only the one equatorial 
                <br>temperature remains at some temperature less than 20-degrees.
                <br>
                <br>Following the submission of our report, government officials push for decreased regulation equivalent to a new k-value of negative 
                <br>one-half. As discussed in our report, a negative k-value ultimately would result in increased temperatures if allowed to be large 
                <br>enough. To determine the exact result for this case, we need to evaluate our rate of change model for when it is zero, ergo not 
                <br>changing, with the k-value of negative one-half.
                <br>
                <br><img src="EQ(9).png" style="margin-left: 350px;">
                <br>
                <br>Using the same process as before of plugging in values around the zeros, we can determine the behavior of our model for different 
                <br>initial temperatures. Rather than do that, as it requires a semi-length discussion, we can depict the behavior through the modified 
                <br>graph [Figure 2.3]. 
                <br>
                <br><img src="Figure2-3.png" style="width: 500px;margin-left: 275px;padding-top: 20px;">
                <br><a style="margin-left: 435px;font-size: 10px;">[Figure 2.3](desmos.com)</a>
                <br>
                <br>Although it is difficult to see in the image above, there is a slight peak below the t-axis where the temperature holds the trend 
                <br>to decrease.
                <br>
                <br><img src="Figure2-4.png" style="width: 500px;margin-left: 275px;padding-top: 20px;">
                <br><a style="margin-left: 435px;font-size: 10px;">[Figure 2.4](desmos.com)</a>
                <br>
                <br>Recalling ideas from our previous discussion, we can see that an initial condition of 20-degrees Celsius lies above the t-axis, 
                <br>meaning that there is a trend for temperature increase approaching a new equatorial temperature of 20.807-degrees, if given enough time.
                <br>
                <br>After some time in the future, allowing the system to reach equilibrium, the Smokestack Association was able to lobby for a 5-percent 
                <br>change in regulation equivalent to a k-value of negative twenty-one fortieths. Still being a negative value, the trend to shifting the 
                <br>graph up remains. 
                <br>
                <br><img src="Figure2-5.png" style="width: 500px;margin-left: 275px;padding-top: 20px;">
                <br><a style="margin-left: 435px;font-size: 10px;">[Figure 2.5](desmos.com)</a>
                <br>
                <br>While the change in regulation was very subtle, the result was enough to completely remove two of the equatorial temperatures 
                <br>resulting in as discussed before [Figure 2.5], one remaining equatorial point. Given enough time, a temperature previously limited 
                <br>by these equatorial temperatures would experience a significant change. In the previous model, the temperature increased and was 
                <br>rebounded by an equatorial temperature of 20.807-degrees, which now with the decreased regulation is no longer bounded by that 
                <br>equatorial temperature and is now bounded by the final remaining equatorial temperature of 26.201-degrees.
                <br>
                <br>Government officials eventually decided against deregulating emission and increased regulation back to an equivalent of a k-value 
                <br>of negative one-half. Referring back to the graph of our model with this k-value [Figure 2.3], a new initial condition of 26.201-degrees 
                <br>lies below the t-axis meaning a decrease in temperature would occur until eventually approaching the equatorial temperature of 
                <br>26.193-degrees.
                <br>
                <br>Following, the major global temperature up rises, government officials decided to completely go back to regulating no emissions, 
                <br>equivalent to a k-value of zero. Again, as previously discussed, both graphically and descriptively, a temperature above 26-degrees 
                <br>for a k-value of zero, results in a negative rate and thus a decrease in temperature approaching 26-degrees. This would mean that 
                <br>after all the changes were implemented, the equatorial temperature increased from 20-degrees Celsius to 26-degrees Celsius.
                <br>
                <br>Changing regulations relationship with equatorial temperatures is majorly affected by initial conditions. Just because a regulation 
                <br>worked to hold a certain temperature before, does not necessarily mean that the same regulation would return any initial temperature 
                <br>back to that equatorial temperature.
                <br>
                <br>In order to return to our initial condition, it is easiest to explain through a bifurcation diagram, which displays how temperature 
                <br>behaves in comparison to different values for regulation. A bifurcation diagram can also be explained as a set amount of phase lines 
                <br>stacked side by side in order of increasing values for k. As we begin to visualize each of these phase lines, we can see that the 
                <br>bifurcation graph being formed is just our model equation reflected across y=x.
                <br>

                <br><a style="margin-left: 435px;font-size: 10px;">[Figure 2.8](desmos.com)</a>
                <br>
                <br>The bifurcation diagram provides an easy visual for how the temperature is affected for different initial conditions and different 
                <br>values of k. The area highlighted in blue, represents initial values that have a trend to decrease approaching the black line. The 
                <br>area highlighted in red, represents initial values that have a trend to increase approaching the black line. We can see in this 
                <br>bifurcation our initial condition after the change in regulation is now at C=26, where C is the vertical axis and the k-value is 
                <br>represented by the horizontal axis. As we increase regulation, moving to the right, there is a trend in decreasing temperatures 
                <br>that allows the temperature to drop down slowly until it passes the hump and is able to decrease more rapidly towards a value 
                <br>below our first initial condition of C=20-degrees. After C is a value below 20, regulation can be reset to zero and the 
                <br>temperature will hold a trend to approach a equatorial temperature of 20-degrees Celsius.
